The ability to test code is the most important quality of any software product. Without proper testing, it is prohibitively expensive to refactor the code or to improve any other part of it, such as its security, scalability, or performance. In this chapter, we'll learn how to design and manage automated tests and how to correctly use fakes and mocks when it is necessary to do so.

本章将讨论以下内容:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Why do you test code?

\item 
Introducing testing frameworks

\item 
Understanding mocks and fakes

\item 
Test-driven class design

\item 
Automating tests for continuous integration/continuous deployment
\end{itemize}
