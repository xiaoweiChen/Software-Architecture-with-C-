After establishing the proper tests, it is necessary to perform a security audit to make sure our application will not be used for malicious purposes. This chapter describes how to assess the security of the code base, including both the internally developed software as well as third-party modules. It will also show how to improve existing software both at the code level and at the operating system level.

You'll learn how to design applications with a focus on security at each level, starting with code, through to dependencies, architecture, and deployment.

本章将讨论以下内容:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Checking the code security

\item 
Checking whether the dependencies are secure

\item 
Hardening your code

\item 
Hardening your environment
\end{itemize}
