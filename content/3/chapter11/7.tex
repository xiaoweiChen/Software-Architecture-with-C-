\begin{enumerate}
\item
What can we learn from the performance results from this chapter's microbenchmarks?

\item
Is how we traverse a multi-dimensional array important for performance? Why/why not?

\item
In our coroutines example, why can't we create our thread pool inside the do\_routine\_work function?

\item
How can we rework our coroutine example so it uses a generator instead of just tasks?
