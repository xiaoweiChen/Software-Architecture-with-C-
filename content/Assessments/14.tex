\begin{enumerate}
\item
How do application containers differ from operating system containers?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Application containers are designed to host a single process, while operating system containers usually run all the processes typically available in a Unix system.
\end{itemize}

\item
What are some early examples of sandboxing environments in UNIX systems?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
chroot, BSD Jails, Solaris Zones.
\end{itemize}

\item
Why are containers a good fit for microservices?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
They offer a unified interface to run applications regardless of the underlying technology.
\end{itemize}

\item
What are the main differences between containers and virtual machines?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Containers are more lightweight as they don't require a hypervisor, a copy of an operating system kernel, or auxiliary processes, such as an init system or syslog.
\end{itemize}

\item
When are application containers a bad choice?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
When you want to put a multi-process application in a single container.
\end{itemize}

\item
What are some tools to build multi-platform container images?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
manifest-tool, docker buildx.
\end{itemize}

\item
Besides Docker, what are some other container runtimes?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Podman, containerd, CRI-O.
\end{itemize}

\item
What are some popular orchestrators?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad.
\end{itemize}
