\begin{enumerate}
\item
In what ways does CI save time during development?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
It allows you to catch bugs earlier and fix them before they enter production.
\end{itemize}

\item
Do you require separate tools to implement CI and CD?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The pipelines are usually written using a single tool; multiple tools are used for actual testing and deployment.
\end{itemize}

\item
When does it make sense to perform a code review in a meeting?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
When an asynchronous code review is taking too long.
\end{itemize}

\item
What tools can you use to assess the quality of your code during CI?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Tests, static analysis.
\end{itemize}

\item
Who participates in specifying the BDD scenarios?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Developers, QA, the business.
\end{itemize}

\item
When would you consider using immutable infrastructure? When would you rule it out?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
It is best used with stateless services or services that can outsource storage using a database or a network storage. It is not suitable for stateful services.
\end{itemize}

\item
How would you characterize the differences between Ansible, Packer, and Terraform?
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Ansible is designed for the configuration management of existing VMs, Packer is for building cloud VM images, and Terraform is for building the cloud infrastructure (such as networks, VMs, and load balancers).
\end{itemize}
