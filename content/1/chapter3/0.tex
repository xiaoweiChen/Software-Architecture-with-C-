As an architect, it is important for you to recognize which requirements are significant for the architecture and why. This chapter will teach you about the various requirements of a solution—functional and nonfunctional. Functional requirements are those that tell you what your solution should do. On the other hand, nonfunctional ones are those that tell you how your solution should be.

\begin{itemize}
\item Understanding the types of requirements
