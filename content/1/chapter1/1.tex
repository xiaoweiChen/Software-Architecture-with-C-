To play with the code from this chapter, you'll need the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
A Git client for checking out the repositories given shortly.

\item 
A C++20-compliant compiler to compile all the snippets. Most of them are written in C++11/14/17, but concept support is required to experiment with the few that touch the subject.

\item 
GitHub link for code snippets: \url{https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Software-Architecture-with-Cpp/tree/master/Chapter01}.

\item 
GitHub link for GSL: \url{https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL}

\end{itemize}
