The purpose of this introductory chapter is to show what role software architecture plays in software development. It will focus on the key aspects to keep in mind when designing the architecture of a C++ solution. We'll discuss how to design efficient code with convenient and functional interfaces. We'll also introduce a domain-driven approach for both code and architecture.
