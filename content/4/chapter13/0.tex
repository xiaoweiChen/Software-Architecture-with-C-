With the increasing popularity of microservices, we would like to dedicate to them an entire chapter of this book. When discussing architecture, you will probably at some point hear, "Should we use microservices for that?" This chapter will show you how to migrate an existing application to a microservices architecture and how to build a new application that leverages microservices.

本章将讨论以下内容:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Diving into microservices

\item 
Building microservices

\item 
Observing microservices

\item 
Connecting microservices

\item 
Scaling microservices
\end{itemize}
