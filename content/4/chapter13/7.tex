Microservices are a great new trend in software architecture. They could be a good fit provided you make sure you know about the hazards and prepare for them. This chapter explained the common design and migration patterns that help to introduce microservices. We've also covered advanced topics such as observability and connectivity that are crucial when establishing microservices-based architectures.

By now, you should be able to design and decompose applications into individual microservices. Each microservice is then capable of processing a single piece of workload.

While microservices are valid on their own, they're especially popular in combination with containers. Containers are the subject of the next chapter.
