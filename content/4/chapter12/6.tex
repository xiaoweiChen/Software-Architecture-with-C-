In this chapter, we have learned about different approaches to implementing ServiceOriented Architecture. Since a service may interact with its environment in different ways, there are many architectural patterns to choose from. We've learned about the benefits and disadvantages of the most popular ones.

We have focused on the architectural and implementational aspects of some of the widely popular approaches: message queues, web services including REST, and using managed services and cloud platforms. Other approaches that we will dig even deeper into will be presented in the standalone chapters, such as microservices and containers.

In the next chapter, we'll look into microservices.
