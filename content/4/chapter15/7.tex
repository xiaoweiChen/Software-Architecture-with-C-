Congratulations on reaching the end of the chapter! Using modern C++ is not limited to understanding the recently added language features. Your applications will run in production. As an architect, it's also your choice to make sure the runtime environment matches requirements. In the few previous chapters, we described some popular trends in distributed applications. We hope this knowledge will help you decide which one is the best fit for your product.

Going cloud-native brings a lot of benefits and can automate a good chunk of your workflow. Switching custom-made tools to industry standards makes your software more resilient and easier to update. In this chapter, we have covered the pros, cons, and use cases of popular cloud-native solutions.

Some, such as distributed tracing with Jaeger, bring immediate benefits to most projects. Others, such as Istio or Kubernetes, perform best in large-scale operations. After reading this chapter, you should have sufficient knowledge to decide whether introducing cloudnative design into your application is worth the cost.
