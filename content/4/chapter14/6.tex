When you are an architect of modern software, you have to take into account modern technologies. Taking them into account doesn't mean following the trends blindly; it means being able to objectively assess whether a particular proposition makes sense in your case or not.

Both microservices, presented in the previous chapters, and containers, presented in this chapter, are worth considering and understanding. Are they worth implementing as well? It depends heavily on what type of product you are designing. If you've read this far, you are ready to make the decision for yourself.

The next chapter is dedicated to cloud-native design. A very interesting but also a complex topic that ties in service-oriented architecture, CI/CD, microservices, containers, and cloud services. As it turns out, the great performance of C++ is a welcome feature for some of the cloud-native building blocks.
