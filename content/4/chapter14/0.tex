Transitioning from development to production has always been a painful process. It involves a lot of documentation, hand-offs, installation, and configuration. Since every programming language produces software that behaves slightly differently, the deployment of heterogenous applications is always difficult.

Some of these problems have been mitigated by containers. With containers, the installation and configuration is mostly standardized. There are several ways for how to deal with distribution, but this issue also has some standards to follow. This makes containers a great choice for organizations that want to increase the cooperation between development and operations.
