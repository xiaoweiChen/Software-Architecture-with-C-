Thank you for coming this far on this journey through software architecture. Our goal in writing this book was to help you make informed decisions regarding the design of your applications and systems. By now, you should feel confident when deciding whether to choose IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, or FaaS.

There are a lot of things we haven't even touched on in this book as they were extensive and out of the scope of the book. Either we had too little experience with the given topic, or we thought that it was too niche. There are also areas that we felt were very important, but we couldn't find the right place for them in the chapters. You'll find them in this appendix.
