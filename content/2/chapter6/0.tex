C++ is not just an object-oriented language, and it doesn't just offer dynamic polymorphism,
so design in C++ is not just about the Gang of Four patterns. In this chapter, you will learn
about the commonly used C++ idioms and design patterns and where to use them.

本章将讨论以下内容:

\begin{itemize}
\item Writing idiomatic C++
\item Curiously recurring template pattern
\item Creating objects
\item Tracking state and visiting objects in C++
\item Dealing with memory efficiently
\end{itemize}

That's quite a list! Let's not waste time and jump right in.
