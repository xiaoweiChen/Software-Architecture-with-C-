In this chapter, we learned about many C++ features and their impact on writing concise, expressive, and performant C++ code. We learned about providing proper C++ component interfaces. You're now able to apply principles such as RAII to write elegant code that's free from resource leaks. You also know how to leverage types such as std::optional to express your intent better in your interfaces.

Next, we demonstrated how to use features such as generic and template lambdas, as well as if constexpr for writing less code that will work with many types. You're now also able to define objects in a clear manner using designated initializers. Afterward, you learned how to write simple code in a declarative style using standard ranges, how to write code that can be executed at both compile time and runtime using constexpr, and how to write more constrained templated code using concepts.

Finally, we demoed how to write modular code with C++ modules. In the next chapter, we'll discuss how to design C++ code so that we can build upon the available idioms and patterns.
