The C++ language is a unique beast. It's used in a plethora of cases, varying from creating firmware and operating systems, desktop and mobile applications, to server software, frameworks, and services. C++ code runs on all kinds of hardware, is massively deployed on compute clouds, and can even be found in outer space. Such success wouldn't have been possible without the broad set of features this multi-paradigm language has.

This chapter describes how to leverage what the C++ language offers so that we can achieve safe and performant solutions. We will demonstrate the best industry practices for type safety, avoiding memory issues, and creating efficient code in an equally efficient manner. We will also teach you how to use certain language features when designing APIs.


本章将讨论以下内容:

\begin{itemize}
\item Moving computations from runtime to compile time
\item Leveraging the power of safe types
\item Creating easy to read and performant code
\item Dividing code into modules
\end{itemize}

During this journey, you'll learn about the features and techniques that are available in various standards of C++, ranging from C++98 all the way to C++20. This will include declarative programming, RAII, \textit{constexpr}, templates, concepts, and modules. Without further ado, let's begin this journey.
